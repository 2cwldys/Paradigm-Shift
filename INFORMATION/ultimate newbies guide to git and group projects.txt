Hey, 2cwldys here. Project Lead of Paradigm Shift.

Thank you for opening this document, because today we are going to cover some serious rule of thumb and how to ensure a secure, safe group project.

- Pay attention to github webhooks, if they are provided (in discord or external third party applications).
- Every time you sit down on your computer, to work on this project, check the github repo for any new commits, and pull other's work before doing anything.
- Don't ever overwrite eachother's work, go into voice with those you collaborate with before dealing with crossovers.
- Don't push every little change, push major amounts of work or at least the work you've done before you stopped for the day. (or awaiting expected files)

It is crucial that every development member, and contributors even, stay in contact with eachother.. direct communication, and don't feel afraid to ask and cooperate on certain plugins!
